[1] clip planes (AMD)

Problem:
When enabling or disabling clip planes, shader's uniforms may be forgotten or taken from... future.
Imagine this:
1. Rendering red mesh.
2. Rendering green mesh.
3. Rendering blue mesh.
Colours are set with uniforms. Now we don't provide colour for second mesh.
We get two red meshes and one blue.
If we would put glEnable(GL_CLIP_PLANE0) between 1 and 2 we will end up with one red mesh and two blue!

Solution:
Always keep clip planes enabled and set those that are not needed to 0,0,0,0.

Solution:
Do not use fixed pipeline. Implement own vertex and fragment shaders with buffers.


[2] shader attribute order (AMD)

Problem:
If we have attributes defined in shader, their order depend on their names and that's fine.
We then get such order:
inColour
inNormal
inPosition
If first parameter is not bound with array but with vertex value, whole thing won't be rendered.

Solution:
Name attributes in such manner that those that are always required are earlier:
inAPosition
inOColour
inONormal
in ALWAYS position
in OPTIONAL colour/normal


[3] clip planes 2 (AMD)

Problem:
When setting two clip planes and then one (by clearing all params) clip planes are incorrect.

Solution:
Set all enabled clip planes (just set them with same values)

Solution:
Do not use fixed pipeline. Implement own vertex and fragment shaders with buffers.


1.	LIGHT / REFLECTION
	All objects have "light/reflection" calculated against viewer.
	This uses texture with:
		X/U	used as colour/type of material
		Y/V	used as light/reflection value
			0 is parallel to viewer sight
			1 is perpendicular to viewer
		RGB	is actual colour of object
		A	is value used for fresnel
			1.0 - A is how much of fresnel is added
	Vertex shader outputs varLight that is also used by fragment shader to calculate how
	each light texture is applied (see light textures)
		
2.	GLOBAL / DOMINANT LIGHT
	All object in Room are lighted by single global/dominant light
	Light uses textures:
		R MODULATE - modulates RGB colour (multiplies each component)
		G MODIFY - modifies RGB colour (turns into gray-scale and then into colour)
		B FRESNEL - only fresnel
	each one:
		X/U used as some fluctuation/randomisation? THINK - TODO
		Y/V used as actual light
			0 is opposite of light
			1 is towards light
		RGB	colour modifies objects colour (it modulates desaturated value (R+G+B) / 3)
		A	how much does it affect objects colour (it is increased by object's alpha)

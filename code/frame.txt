preadvance
==========
player input - done in pre advance


world advance logic
===================
collisions (gradients)
presence (gravity)
/logic
/locomotion
prepare next velocity (and displacement)
appearance
	+-	logic
	+-	preliminary pose - process animations, get velocity
	+-	process controllers that may influence velocity
prepare move (combines collision)


world advance physically
========================
move
appearance - calculate pose

1. displays:
	- no shadowmasks for displays
	- simplier postprocess
2. general shader:
	- voxel alterations are hard coded
	- simplified reflections (no full background)
	- no speculars (sqrt)
	- lowp for colours, uses and other minor stuff
	- background is used less often
	- no normalizations
3. mesh generation:
	- less sub divisions (much less)
	- less details
	- not generating particular edge meshes at all or without cross sections
4. other custom:
	- less palmers in temple station
	- no clouds
	- almost no blending! the only one left is on the displays
	- pilgrim has simpler meshes
	- added "unified fog" to not calculate fog for objects per pixel but per object, done for devices, npcs, pilgrim
	- health colour is used via global tint
